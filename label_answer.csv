Elsalam Alikom every one Any one know about qatar petroleum technical site interview process ( 2days visit) as i recive the visit visa and they ask me for the earlist date to attand and also how much does it take to decide the day of interview ?? Many thanks	If you have been invited for interview in Doha; it's likely (in my opinion) that you will be made an offer. The two days will allow enough time for you to undergo a medical; meet other staff/management; have a look around Doha; at housing available etc. Good luck.	0

Many thanks	the interviewing department will endorse their evaluation about you to HR. If positive; HR will send you offer letter.. after you have accepted and agreed the offer; you need to wait 2-3 months (sometimes longer than this period) for visa processing and wait for your schedule of mobiization.	0
I am in the process of coming over to work in Doha. I wanted to know if their were any specific shots and vaccinations I should get before coming over. I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.	Yes there are; though it varies depending on which country you come from. In the UK; the doctor has a list of all countries and the vaccinations needed for each. I'll imagine they have the same in the US.	1
I am in the process of coming over to work in Doha. I wanted to know if their were any specific shots and vaccinations I should get before coming over. I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.	I suggest going to visit your local GP and mention that you are moving to Qatar. They should have in their system what shots you need before coming over. It is usually for hepatitis and thyfoid i think (please excuse the spelling)	1

I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.	It depends what you have had already. You don't specifically need any extra vaccinations as long as you are up to date with the usual ones you have in the UK (not sure about US) but you can have Rabies as optional if you want. Although there is no requirement or need to have any extra protection here; it is important to remember that lots of people travel East on holidays and if you do you will need the standard typhoid; yellow fever; etc. Children need to have been vaccinated against TB before they can start school. In the UK they no longer give BCG so important to get that done before you come.	1
I am in the process of coming over to work in Doha. I wanted to know if their were any specific shots and vaccinations I should get before coming over. I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.	As I said; the official advice is that you don't HAVE to; however; they may offer you Rabies; Typhoid and Hep B as an option. As they no longer boost Tetanus as routine; you would have to have a booster before coming. That said; the UK has a vey hands off approach to immunisation at the moment as most diseases are sufficiently covered by herd immunity (where because the majority have been vaccinated the people who haven't are covered to a large extent) and cases are low. Personally as long as there is a low risk; I would have all the vaccinations I could; why not?	1

I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.	"We came from here from the US and had Hep A; Typhoid; and Tdap (combined Tetanus; Diptheria; Pertussis) on top of the usual program. The Hep A was a two dose one; given six months apart. We went to our local Kelsey-Seybold clinic there and were given an international certificate of vaccination as approved by the World Health Organisation. *********** ""There's this thing called being so open-minded your brains drop out"". - Richard Dawkins"	1
I am considering getting a job in Qatar and I have two very well behaved people friendly spayed pitbulls. Apparently this breed is banned. Would I have trouble importing them? If anything happened to the dogs; my husband would die; and he will not leave them in Canada if we go away. So I have to be sure they would be ok to be imported before considering taking a job.	If they are 'banned'; as you suggest; then it obviously means that your are not allowed to bring them into Qatar.	2

Custom is not going to let them in... frankly speaking; for me it sounds a bit nonsense ""very well behaved people friendly pitbulls"".. as for me; these two don't come together; it's EITHER ""very well behaved people friendly"" or ""pitbulls"".. sorry; eh?... hope your husband won't be able to figure out my real name and address.. :)"	1

Yes you can bring it but be careful this kind of dog is very very very dangerous. Because I have one that my friend brought it to my last year from Kuwait. You can talk to Doha Airport to be sure about that.	2

"As of now; temperature in doha is (today) Max: 30C Min: 25C Humidity: 58% and in winter season (october-march) temperatures tend to go down a little bit (even close to 10C or even below; mainly in dec-jan).

i am just curious how cold is doha during winter?	In 2006 it was a lovely winter. It was dark; cloudy and rained for almost every day in December. We got trapped in Doha on new years eve and were unable to get to Dukhan such was the torrential rain. It rained on and off until April and then warmed up. The coldest night was 5C but generally 7C. I remember it rained when my parents were here and that was April 2007. This last winter wasn't very cold at all; only a few days of rain and never really got below 10C at night. I love winters here; they are so cosy. On the down side; houses are not built for winter so prepare to freeze and get leaks driping everywhere. The roads don't drain very well so very wet.	2

While driving in Doha last night I witness a sad incident. A man was driving with his child on his lap. He had to make an emergency stop and his childs head impacted the steering wheel. The poor child was bleeding and crying. Many times I have seen children not properly secured in vehicles. Is there not a law regarding child safety in vehicles here in Qatar?	there is a law. No children under 10 in the front seats. Unfortunately this law is not enforced. Did you take the guys license plate # and report him? Maybe if he got a large fine it would impact him rather than his child. poor child has an idiot for a parent.	1

What carseat brands are available in Qatar? I´m just not sure if I should bring the kids carseats from Norway; not sure how the airlines will treat the seats; and are a bit worried that they will break them.	"While car seats are available in Qatar; they're bound to be pricier than the ones you have already; and the selection will not exactly ""wow"" you. Unfortunately I can't tell you what brands are available here since I haven't paid them any attention. I brought my two Britax Boulevards with us from the U.S. and they came through fine. I do recommend purchasing car seat travel bags if you can find them in Norway because it will definitely help keep the cloth cover in better shape. If you can't find them; though; the airline will put it in a very heavy-duty plastic bag. Hope that helps; Expat Sueño P.S. I am starting a Mums and Kids group here in Doha for expats. Be sure to get in touch with me when you arrive (or before if you have any questions). We'll have playgroups; Mums Night Out; and Expectant Moms Group; etc. There are no dues or anything like that. . .just fun :o)"	0

What carseat brands are available in Qatar? I´m just not sure if I should bring the kids carseats from Norway; not sure how the airlines will treat the seats; and are a bit worried that they will break them.	"This is one of my pet peaves...back home (Houston; Texas) children;according to their age; must be in a car seat. Knowing that this law does not exist here and how upset I would get; my husband warned me before hand; ""Now; you're gonna see a lot of children that should be in car seats and they're not."" NOT having children in carseats; in the event of an accident; can lead to paralysis or even death. Everyone should wear their safety belts. SAD STORY: (I was a high school teacher) One of my students; Eric; had just earned a full football scholarship to the University of Texas. One night; he was in the backseat of a mid-size car and had fallen asleep and was not wearing his seat belt. The driver of the car Eric was in was in an accident..another driver had run a red light and side swiped their car. Eric was the only one rushed to the hopital. The others had been wearing their seatbelts and were not injured. Eric was paralyzed. Consequently; he was not able to play ball for UT. The UT law....."	0

Cynbob: My children are not to ride in a car without the right carseats.

If I can´t be sure to get well known car seats in Qatar; I will bring the seats that we have here. A little more luggage; but nothing is more important than the safety of the children.	0

Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks	Hi; I am sure most of the guyz answered your query; if you need more details; read the follwoing: The role of the red blood cells is to carry oxygen through the body. The red blood cells can perform this task because of the presence of hemoglobin; the pigment that is formed when the red blood cells develop in the bone marrow. Each hemoglobin molecule is made up of a protein molecule called globin and four pigmented molecules of a compound called heme. Each heme molecule has one atom of iron; and there are four heme molecules in a single molecule of hemoglobin; hence; a single molecule of hemoglobin has four atoms of iron. This structure makes it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecules to form a substance called oxyhemoglobin. This reaction is reversible; enabling hemoglobin to pick up oxygen when the blood is in the lungs and to release oxygen in the cells when the blood is pumped to the tissues. In general; the blood of men usually has a greater concent.....	1
Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks	"Hemoglobin is a protein that is carried by red cells. It picks up oxygen in the lungs and delivers it to the peripheral tissues to maintain the viability of cells. Hemoglobin is made from two similar proteins that ""stick together"". Both proteins must be present for the hemoglobin to pick up and release oxygen normally. One of the component proteins is called alpha; the other is beta. Before birth; the beta protein is not expressed. A hemoglobin protein found only during fetal development; called gamma; substitutes up until birth."	1
Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks	Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to Heart and to continue the Inhaling and Exhaling Proccess. They are responsible of Healing any kind of cut ; they stop the blood flow and they are also reponsible to open any kind of plaque inside vains to prevent heart attacks. IF you smoke Hemoglobin will carry the necotin every where it goes because Necotine get stuck on the hemoglobin and reduce its functions so the hemoglobin wont be holding much oxygen in every breathing proccess thats why we see people who smokes breathes more than natural people when they do any activity . There body needs Oxygen but the hemo. aint functioning in the way they have to .	1

If your coming from Outer Space you need to find the Virgo Supercluster first; then within that the Virgo cluster. Once you found that look out for the Local Group. In there is the Milky Way galaxy. Some 27.000 lightyears from the center is a small star with eight planets. Go to the third one from the sun and find the continent of Asia. Look at the western portion and identify Qatar. Then find Doha. Once you are in Doha and found the Land Mark Mall enter the new highway. You will soon see the American Embassy on your right. If you pass it you have to do it all again.	0

Not like new comer Indian people who use bicycle before and now make so many accident in Doha. Every day I see 5-6 accident. Driver? So sorry just true-Indian. GOod luck in driving with proper documents. Penalty is tooooo .....	2
I have visiting visa for work; so can I drive; I have egyptian license?	If you are on a visiting Visa and and you have an international driver license you can use it for 6 month I guess. If you get the permanent residence you can not use the Int driver license anymore.	1
I have visiting visa for work; so can I drive; I have egyptian license?	Mr.Calculator consumes major space for the same answer which is not helping the person with right answer?!; you can not drive a car with Egypitian licence here; as a visitor first 10 days you can drive but later you need to take a temporary driving licence for 3 months. you have to pay 100 riyal for every month and need to take eye-test for this licence.	2
I have visiting visa for work; so can I drive; I have egyptian license?	No; you cannot drive; you should have a GCC license not Egyptian.	2
I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	The Rental companies ask for an International License.	2

I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	Even if you have a International License; you need to get a temporary license from Traffic Department. When you are in Doha; get the application for temporary license and submit it to the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department along with copy of your US license and passport pages showing your identity and visa page You might need to get an NOC from the sponsor (Typed in Arabic) if you visit here under visa from some company or sponsor. Best way is to ask the rental car company to assist you to get it.	2
I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	If you in vist visa you can drive; but if you want to cavnt to qatari ; so you can apply easly just vist to traffic dept and ask for new one.	1
I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	Supposedly the US license is good for (7) days. An international license is good for (6) months. They are easily obtained from AAA for about $15. After (6) months and likely before then you would need to go for a Qatar drivers license.	1
I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	I recommend that you go to a AAA agency and get an international license. Driving here in Doha is pretty dangerous- so I recommend you take every measure to protect yourself. It is pretty easy and not costly. See you when you get here!	0
Hello QatarLiving! My family and I will be away for vacation. PLEASE tell me about the reliable places in Doha where you put your dog in when you’re out of town!! I don’t know where to take him and I don’t trust anyone to do that for me :-(	Call Paul Hensen. His number 487 7144 and mobile 667 5235.

Hello QatarLiving! My family and I will be away for vacation. PLEASE tell me about the reliable places in Doha where you put your dog in when you’re out of town!! I don’t know where to take him and I don’t trust anyone to do that for me :-(	"Ok; I have a cat. But we take him to Pampered Pets whenever we travel. They also board dogs... The do a great job; and I know lots of people who take their animals there. If your dog is social; he can play with the other dogs each day. If not; he can stay by himself. They cater to each individual animal and know them by name. (I'm ""Rackety's owner""-- they know him; not me!) The only catch is that they book up really far in advance. Call as far in advance as you can to book your space. Website: www.ppkdoha.com You can see photos of the place and get all the details there. They are way out of town; but will pick up your dog if you can't make it out there."	2

Hello guys..I want to take NHA licensure(Nurse) here in Qatar but I dont have any work experience in the Philippines..I'm currently working here now as a nurse in a construction company for almost 1yr..Will NHA allowed me to take licensure here even if I don't have the necessary experience required? Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..	You must have two years of work experience to apply for the license. You can work for another year and carry on with it. Since you are on company sponsorship I think you can work for another year and then apply. Hope this helps	2

Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..	You shouldn't be working ANYWHERE in Qatar WITHOUT an NHA license;so continuing in your current job for another year & then showing that to NHA as work experience may not be the best idea because as of now you are working ILLEGALLY!...you need to have minimum 2 years work experience OUTSIDE Qatar before coming here;if you could be employed legally here without an NHA license;what's the point of them conducting the exam???...so if you want to legally work in Qatar;go back to your home country(doesn't matter where as long as you work LEGALLY.);get two years LEGAL work experience then come back here;get your degree;certificates & work experience reviewed by Dataflow;then apply to take the licensure exam...	1

Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..	I think work experience is not a prerequisite for taking the NHA exam that is now handled by Prometric. You can try to schedule the exam online. However; there's no point of taking the exam without the required work experience since it is one of the requirements to get NHA license. Moreover; if you pass the exam; the validity is only for 2 years; otherwise you have to take it again.	1

Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..	you can take Prometric exam without experience. My exam's validity is 3 yrs... There are many nurses out there are working without license.

Or else if you have plenty of time in hand order online. Just keep in mind while placing an online order that you have minimum of a month and a half before your wedding. So you can do necessary adjustments in your dress as well; if required. Never Ask for a SMILE..just GIVE it..	0

Each employee is entitled to a free return air ticket within QR network for herself/himself; and her/his family (depending on one's grade). Which class they are entitled to is also dependent on the grade. They are also entitled to purchase discounted tickets; but that is on sub-load basis meaning the the seats are not confirmed and one could be bumped out in the last moment in case flights are full. It's an industry practice.	2

Where can I find/buy Lego Blocks here in Qatar? Tried Toys R Us; Villagio; City Center and Landmark but to no avail.	"in the Hallmark store in The Mall - pink and blue plastic tubs with maybe 250 piece sets inside. But I ended up having a friend who was visiting bring some back from Denmark. But I second what marycatherine said: order them online and ship them in. Doha is not a place that you depend upon for anything to be in stock anywhere. I wish I could drink like a lady. I can take one or two at the most. Three and I'm under the table. Four and I'm under the host"" -- Dorothy Parker"	0

If you came on Business Visa and stay more than 1 month; you will need an Exit permit. And if you have an RP here; you will DEFINITELY need an exit permit from your sponsor; unless you are under your husband's sponsorship. Whoever say ""Lady's do not need an exit permit""; have no clue what they are saying...again; all depends on your status here"	1

In my view Qatar pay more Salary for workers in Gulf region. my friend argu Kuwait. which country paying more salary for workers?	I think it depends on your job but I would say the best payers are Saudi Arabia closely followed by Kuwait but neither of those places are pleasant enough to endure just for a few more bills in your pay cheque. The UAE pays ok and Abu Dhabi is a cheaper and more interesting place to live than Qatar.	2
In my view Qatar pay more Salary for workers in Gulf region. my friend argu Kuwait. which country paying more salary for workers?	Yeah; may be Qatar. Simply because of the cost of living compared to other GCC countries much higher here. Saudi is not paying good salary for the workers. But the workers can enjoy free food and accommodation there with majority of employers.	2
In my view Qatar pay more Salary for workers in Gulf region. my friend argu Kuwait. which country paying more salary for workers?

How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	Just today i went for the workpermit medical. I think the process works as follows: 1. Your company applies online for WP and you get a piece of paper that it is issued. - Max 1 week. 2. They get a medical date - another week max. 3. Finger printing - another 3-4 days. 4. WP card - another 2-3 days. above days are just from my personal experience and may vary.	2
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	these are two different things.. Tepgam67 is asking about Work permit while being on Family visa. shapil is talking about residence permit. that's what happens when unprofessional people try to give an advice. Tepgam67; if you have an RP here; to obtain a Work permit you need police clearance and the contract certified in MOL. How long it takes to finalize the process depends on several factors. ometimes it takes 3-4 days; sometimes it takes 1 month and even more. If you don't have an RP here (i.e. you are on 6 months family visa); you cannot work; and therefore you cannot obtain a Work permit.	2
Hi all; I hope some one to help me; I have an offer letter from a company in Qatar and by today it has been 2 monthes since I sent them all required papers for the Visa and still they said it's not ready yet. (I'm Syrian) my question how long does it usually take and what is the maximum duration ? Thanks in advance ارجوكم ساعدوني	I am facing the same; I was informed that syrian visa is not easy it get. If you are single; ask them to get you on business visa which could be valid for 3 months..till they get u the RP. Good luck	0

Do ask to see their Ministry registration. Outside of this there is the home provision by employing a Nanny; which is a costly activity initially. There is also many who will offer the service privately unregulated. Its your choice who you trust this small child with. Child care should be planned proir to the babys birth. we have nine months to plan for this day and children deserve the best decisions from us . check Doha Mums website . good Luck.	1

I am very interested to know if there are any expatriate tennis clubs in Doha that anyone can join? I am at a decent standard and would like to play once / twice per week so joining a club would be ideal. If anyone (who is also at a decent level) would like a game then please drop me an e-mail and we can arrange something. Thanks	OK; no worries. Maybe play at Shearton inside? I am back in Doha this weekend so drop me a text next week on 589 7136 to organise. Cheers	2

Hair Salon - Has anyone seen a Loreal Salon in Doha? I would assume it may be in one of the hotels/resorts. The salon would have Loreal branding on the window..... Thanks S	You might try Coiffure Francaise at 468-9211. Their ad in Marhaba magazine says they are a l'Oreal salon. They are next to Gulf Crafts in the Haya Commercial plaza.	0
Hair Salon - Has anyone seen a Loreal Salon in Doha? I would assume it may be in one of the hotels/resorts. The salon would have Loreal branding on the window..... Thanks S	"Do NOT go to Coiffure Francaise. I went in with very curly hair and asked Marie Claire; the hair dresser; to cut off ONE inch. She cut at least two inches off the overall length. I already had long layers and she asked me if I wanted layers and ended up cutting VERY short layers. She also cut the very front much shorter than the rest of my hair and then straightened the whole thing. I can not wear it curly because it looks REALLY bad. I have to spend extra time straightening my hair; and it's not growing quickly at all. I can't put it in a pony tail yet; and she cut it three weeks ago. If you see a girl around Doha that looks like she tried to give herself ""the Rachel"" at home; that's me. :("	0
