My query is can I convert their tourist visa to family visit visa even I dont have yet a Qatar ID? My profession in visa is Civil Engineer. Thanks in advance..	Hi Peylenzkie. If my info is not mistaken; you have to apply for RP 1st which takes 10 days or more; then after that; you need to apply your 1 wife to 1 year Family Visit Visa (spouse) which takes 10 days; then convert her Tourist visa to Family Visit Visa (needs Attested Marriage certificate) which takes 3 days. Then lastly; apply for her RP (10 days). So my advice; finish your RP first then apply for their RP later. Tourist visa is 30 days only; not extendable so they have to go out the country.

Hello everyone; I'm already here in Qatar a month ago under business visa with my sponsor. Do I still need an NOC in order to apply for another company here in Qatar if ever I decide to go home on the 3 month period of the business visa? Thanks.	Yes you indeed need an NOC in Original if you need to go back and come back to Qatar Basically You will need Old NOC as well as New NOC from the current employer you have arrived her. Regards Felix Pereira
Hello everyone; I'm already here in Qatar a month ago under business visa with my sponsor. Do I still need an NOC in order to apply for another company here in Qatar if ever I decide to go home on the 3 month period of the business visa? Thanks.	why is that so? business visa is good as visit visa right? as long as I have exit stamp with my business visa on that 3 month grace period; I guess there will be no problem if I go back to my country and look again for another employer who will possibly give me a working visa. NOC is only applicable if you had a working visa I supposed.
Hello everyone; I'm already here in Qatar a month ago under business visa with my sponsor. Do I still need an NOC in order to apply for another company here in Qatar if ever I decide to go home on the 3 month period of the business visa? Thanks.	brattykharz u are absolutely right. U can apply for a job. And if u find an employer they will process ur visa from business to work visa. U only need NOC if u want to transfer to another employer after one year service to ur 1st employer.
Hello everyone; I'm already here in Qatar a month ago under business visa with my sponsor. Do I still need an NOC in order to apply for another company here in Qatar if ever I decide to go home on the 3 month period of the business visa? Thanks.	if your current employer didn't transfer your business visa to working visa then u still had a chance to discontinue the work and exit Doha. You just need to have an exit permit from the sponsor of business visa. But if you already had a medical from your current employer then it means that they already applied the change of your visa even if the RP card is not yet given to you and you will be ban for 2 years if you exit Doha. Mostly companies here are not giving NOC; so think twice before you decide.
I'm outside of Qatar for 5 months now; I filed a resignation to my company but they did not allow me. I had to take an emergency leave because of some issues in my homeland. I'm aware that the visa/rp will be cancelled after 6 months of being outside the country but can my employer file an absconding case against me on the ground of non-returning from emergency leave?	A big NO as you are not in Qatar. Do you have any outstanding loans?

Nothing to worry. The sad part is you cannot come to Qatar for 2 years.

MM; you have been on a long emergency leave; normally a leave would be for one month; did you officially request your company that they extend your leave to cover this 5 month period that you have been out of the country or has it been absence without permission. do you have email communications etc supporting your request. hope you have a copy of the resignation letter that you had sent to them and the rejection. i am not sure about the rules applicable for a company sponsored individual to come on husband sponsor within the year.
Can my sponsor cancel my visa even without my passport? Thank you guys...	the RP ID (together with your passport) should be submitted to the Immigration to cancel it. HOWEVER ; THEY(your sponsor) can report you to the CID as absconding/absconded to release them of any responsibility of you. When they get that clearance from the authorities; they will no longer issue you an NOC letter; and may even report your whereabouts to the police and have you deported. That would be the worst scenario. This happened to someone I know 2 years ago. I'm not sure if the procedure changed.
I just want to ask if there is new rules about the ban in Qatar;once you are cancelled. Is there any ways to comeback and seek for a job again?	No new rules if you can't get a NOC to transfer your RP. Yes; there is a way to work again here - wait out the 2 year ban
I just want to ask if there is new rules about the ban in Qatar;once you are cancelled. Is there any ways to comeback and seek for a job again?	No ban for tourist visa
I just want to ask if there is new rules about the ban in Qatar;once you are cancelled. Is there any ways to comeback and seek for a job again?	No ban for Tourist visa; You can come next day if you like.
I just want to ask if there is new rules about the ban in Qatar;once you are cancelled. Is there any ways to comeback and seek for a job again?	6 months ban without NOC could be possible? Please read & comments. However; the law makes it illegal for sponsors and employers to retain employees’ passports and travel documents once their residence permits have been issued. According to Article 4; any expatriate once dismissed from his job or quit on his own will not be allowed to re-enter the country before the elapse of two years from the date of his departure. However; this condition can be waived by the Minister of Interior; or whoever represents him. Also the department (to be designated later) in charge of enforcing the law may exempt some cases from this period based on a written permission from the expatriates’ previous sponsor; according to Article 4. The new law gives the Minister or whoever represents him the power to transfer sponsorship temporarily if there is a legal dispute between the sponsor and the expatriate worker.

(I'm not interested in renting from anyone's friend; thanks!)	Buddy; cheaper cars on rental basis are easy to find in Qatar but the car owners make very strict conditions. i had a bad experience for finding cheaper car like you on rental basis as there was a condition that if car involves in an accident and it's not my fault; i still have to pay the rent for car for the days it stays in garage. THAT'S REDICULOUS.... Big rent a cars like AVIS; BUDGET or THRIFTY etc. you don't have to worry about any thing bcz even you crash their cars; you just have to pay small amount as these cars are fully insured rather than those small rent a cars; who are just waiting for a prey (Customer) and suck all the money you have.... May be it's just me and i don't have any intention to discourage you to get a cheaper car if budget is a concern of yours. Have a safe and joyful weekend.
I just heard that medical treatment for residents is free. And can not believe that. I heard that medical treatment for native qataris is free; which seems plausible.

can one go to dubai for one week and come back here ;if he is under personal visit visa(6 month)? ... is it posible ?	What is this? You need a residence permit to go and come back like that.
can one go to dubai for one week and come back here ;if he is under personal visit visa(6 month)? ... is it posible ?	If you are under visit visa sponsored by a resident you can. Your sponsor go to immigration and request a single jorney re-entry permit (25Qr I think). You go to Dubai and then back. Just return before your visit visa expires.
	Hahahaha...i feel like talking to a 3 yr old kid!!! Yes; it does stay STILL in the AIR before landing because it has to wait for approval. If they are not approved; the pilot can just turn the plane 360 degrees without moving forward and go back to it's destination. nyahahahahah!!!! Did you notice the propeller on top of every aeroplane? That's what keeps it still before landing. Some plane have propellers on their tail as well; but those are only special types of plane developped by aliens.
	"""Certain Fighter aircraft can """"stop"""" while in flight if the pilot does certain maneuvers but during landing? Of course not. On a passenger aircraft? Of course not."""
	NO an air bus cannot stay still; at any moment during flight. The wings cross section make it such that most of the air is forced downwards and smaller fraction over the wings; pushing the plane upwards. Air must be moving toward the plane for the wing to push it below. So the aircraft must be moving towards the air; to get this effect. for the smarter ones out there; you should know that; the speed at which the air hits the wings (basically the aircraft speed plus speed of opposing wind) is proportional to the amount of lift given. helicopters are the same; only that the rotor blades; are the wings and they constantly move in at circular path.
	Commercial aircraft: No Fighter aircraft: Yes. The VTOL enabled planes can do that. VTOL= vertical take off and landing. The Harrier Jump jet is one such aircraft. Google VTOL and you will find a lot of info as well as some youtube videos.
	"""Not only can an Airbus (or any other commercial aircraft) not """"stand still"""" in the air; it must be going at least 155 knots (or approx 175 miles per hour) in order to stay in the air; relative to the wind speed. If it falls below that relative speed it will simply fall out of the air. I remember in the middle of one flight; a passenger called the flight attendant and asked; """"Why have we stopped?"""" Uhhh; ...?!"""
	Technically; a commercial jet can stay still in the air provided we cause the wind to blow at it from the opposite direction at over 600Kmph. This wind must blow towards the nose and through its wings to cause it to get lift force and thus not make any displacement relative to the ground. This wud means it has zero ground speed. An aircraft has two speeds namely groundspeed and airspeed. Airspeed is measured by the amount of air rushing thro' its sensors placed at various points on its outer body. This mechanism and physical aspect of flight is beyond the scope of this discussion and many of you won't even be able grasp the idea.

Hi all; I am taking up an assignment in Qatar and would like to know whether it is allowed to carry photos of Indian gods to Qatar?	shouldnt be a problem. all the hindus here have photos and the idols as well. the photos and idols arent available here so they got to get it from their home country. there is also a new temple built someplace near the indian embassy where they have regular pujas; esp during the festivals. all is fine alhamdullilah. people are tolerant here. happy heart drive safe because someone is waiting for you at home

I just want to ask when start of EID?	6th of November
I just want to ask when start of EID?	6th of November
I just want to ask when start of EID?	I believe it is 70 days after Eid ul-Fitr
I just want to ask when start of EID?	6th November inshallah
I just want to ask when start of EID?	7th nov
I just want to ask when start of EID?	Insha' Allaah it may be on 7th November Since the Islamic calendar is purely lunar; as opposed to solar or luni-solar; the Muslim (Hijri) year is shorter than the Gregorian year by about 11 days; and months in the Islamic (Hijri) year are not related to seasons; which are fundamentally determined by the solar cycle. This means that important Muslim festivals; which always fall in the same Hijri month; may occur in different seasons. For example; the Hajj and RamDHaan can take place in the summer as well as the winter. It is only over a 33 year cycle that lunar months take a complete turn and fall during the same season.
I just want to ask when start of EID?	FROM 6l11 - 10l11l2011
I just want to ask when start of EID?	If you are reffering to Eid Al Adha; it is 70 days after the end of the Month of Ramadan. InshaAllah; it will fall on the second week of November. hope this can enlighten you.

I hope you all will help me regarding this matter.	hi; i too an indian and delivered a baby girl just 4months back at DOHA CLINIC..Well to tell u frankly HMC may charge QR 200-QR 800 both for c-section and normal (not so sure)..since we were utmost cuatious with my first delivery; i opted for PRIVATE centre ; that is; DOHA CLINIC. DOHA CLINIC --- Charges for NORMAL DELIVERY is QR 6900-7300 with 2days stay including meal; nursin chrgs;consumables;medication etc etc. Charges for C-SECTION is QR 11900/- with 3-4days stay including meal; nursing chrgs;consumables; medication etc etc. Al AHLI --- I enquired about the charges only once.and as far as my memory is concerned; the charges for NORMAL SECTION is QR 8000-9000 and C-SECTION is QR 13000-14000/- HMC --- The charges r very minimal and affordable... Its upto u whether u want to go for private or govt.one..I continued going to MUMTAZAH CLINIC CENTRE till my 30weeks but then they referred me to HMC..HMC requires lots of patience and queue; i turned down the idea of delivery there..DOHA CL.....

Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) is the best place in Qatar to give birth; no qualms whatsoever. I read a few points mentioned earlier about sharing the room with 3 other ladies; that's true. But this is only if you are willing to pay QR100/- per day. HMC has a dedicated floor for VIPs that could be booked in advance; only that you would be required to pay about QR800/- per day. These are large rooms with good carpets and furniture for only one patient each and it even has a nice luxurious touch to it plus a good living area with sofas for seating/waiting of male guests and kids. This should be a good option; most people (expats) are not aware of this. By the way; there is a huge demand for these rooms. In terms of the medical care you can expect from HMC; I can tell you without doubts that they are very good and its amongst the best in the world. Its true that there could be individual issues at HMC faced by people and no one can guarantee you that you won't face issues. But I am sure .....

Does anybody has an idea the cost of C-section in private hospital in Doha? We are entitled to Hamad-Al Khor but recently I got sick for 2 weeks and soon after; it was my pregnancy that was affected. I am thinking of opting to a private hospital for better care; but this time we will have to cover for all the expenses. Thanks in advance for your help.	A C-Section in a private hospital can cost you anywhere from 8k to 14k riyals. if you have insurance read the terms properly. You may have to pay the insurance company 600-1000 QR (Depends on the policy). Also; they have a limit for the insurance amount and if the cost is more than the one mentioned then you have to shell out the excess.

Hello Incase you dont go for a C Section; I gave birth in Al Khor with my first baby and it was an excellent experience; the level of care was extremely high; and I would certainly recommend it! I am again pregant now; however based in Doha; if I could give birth again in Al Khor I would! Good luck with whatever choice you make; and remember; do what makes you feel comfortable.

It could be within Qr. 20K from a private hospitals if you are not holding a medical insurance with them. Nevertheless; just pray and have a safe pregnancy. I gave birth to my son 2 years back at Women's Hospital and thank GOD everything went fine.
