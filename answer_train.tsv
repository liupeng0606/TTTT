Elsalam Alikom every one Any one know about qatar petroleum technical site interview process ( 2days visit) as i recive the visit visa and they ask me for the earlist date to attand and also how much does it take to decide the day of interview ?? Many thanks	If you have been invited for interview in Doha; it's likely (in my opinion) that you will be made an offer. The two days will allow enough time for you to undergo a medical; meet other staff/management; have a look around Doha; at housing available etc. Good luck.	2

Many thanks	the interviewing department will endorse their evaluation about you to HR. If positive; HR will send you offer letter.. after you have accepted and agreed the offer; you need to wait 2-3 months (sometimes longer than this period) for visa processing and wait for your schedule of mobiization.	2
I am in the process of coming over to work in Doha. I wanted to know if their were any specific shots and vaccinations I should get before coming over. I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.	Yes there are; though it varies depending on which country you come from. In the UK; the doctor has a list of all countries and the vaccinations needed for each. I'll imagine they have the same in the US.	1
I am in the process of coming over to work in Doha. I wanted to know if their were any specific shots and vaccinations I should get before coming over. I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.	I suggest going to visit your local GP and mention that you are moving to Qatar. They should have in their system what shots you need before coming over. It is usually for hepatitis and thyfoid i think (please excuse the spelling)	1
I am in the process of coming over to work in Doha. I wanted to know if their were any specific shots and vaccinations I should get before coming over. I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.	It depends what you have had already. You don't specifically need any extra vaccinations as long as you are up to date with the usual ones you have in the UK (not sure about US) but you can have Rabies as optional if you want. Although there is no requirement or need to have any extra protection here; it is important to remember that lots of people travel East on holidays and if you do you will need the standard typhoid; yellow fever; etc. Children need to have been vaccinated against TB before they can start school. In the UK they no longer give BCG so important to get that done before you come.	1
I am in the process of coming over to work in Doha. I wanted to know if their were any specific shots and vaccinations I should get before coming over. I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.	As I said; the official advice is that you don't HAVE to; however; they may offer you Rabies; Typhoid and Hep B as an option. As they no longer boost Tetanus as routine; you would have to have a booster before coming. That said; the UK has a vey hands off approach to immunisation at the moment as most diseases are sufficiently covered by herd immunity (where because the majority have been vaccinated the people who haven't are covered to a large extent) and cases are low. Personally as long as there is a low risk; I would have all the vaccinations I could; why not?	1

"""We came from here from the US and had Hep A; Typhoid; and Tdap (combined Tetanus; Diptheria; Pertussis) on top of the usual program. The Hep A was a two dose one; given six months apart. We went to our local Kelsey-Seybold clinic there and were given an international certificate of vaccination as approved by the World Health Organisation. *********** """"There's this thing called being so open-minded your brains drop out"""". - Richard Dawkins"""	1
I am considering getting a job in Qatar and I have two very well behaved people friendly spayed pitbulls. Apparently this breed is banned. Would I have trouble importing them? If anything happened to the dogs; my husband would die; and he will not leave them in Canada if we go away. So I have to be sure they would be ok to be imported before considering taking a job.	If they are 'banned'; as you suggest; then it obviously means that your are not allowed to bring them into Qatar.	0

i am just curious how cold is doha during winter?	In 2006 it was a lovely winter. It was dark; cloudy and rained for almost every day in December. We got trapped in Doha on new years eve and were unable to get to Dukhan such was the torrential rain. It rained on and off until April and then warmed up. The coldest night was 5C but generally 7C. I remember it rained when my parents were here and that was April 2007. This last winter wasn't very cold at all; only a few days of rain and never really got below 10C at night. I love winters here; they are so cosy. On the down side; houses are not built for winter so prepare to freeze and get leaks driping everywhere. The roads don't drain very well so very wet.	0

While driving in Doha last night I witness a sad incident. A man was driving with his child on his lap. He had to make an emergency stop and his childs head impacted the steering wheel. The poor child was bleeding and crying. Many times I have seen children not properly secured in vehicles. Is there not a law regarding child safety in vehicles here in Qatar?	there is a law. No children under 10 in the front seats. Unfortunately this law is not enforced. Did you take the guys license plate # and report him? Maybe if he got a large fine it would impact him rather than his child. poor child has an idiot for a parent.	1

What carseat brands are available in Qatar?

"""While car seats are available in Qatar; they're bound to be pricier than the ones you have already; and the selection will not exactly """"wow"""" you. Unfortunately I can't tell you what brands are available here since I haven't paid them any attention. I brought my two Britax Boulevards with us from the U.S. and they came through fine. I do recommend purchasing car seat travel bags if you can find them in Norway because it will definitely help keep the cloth cover in better shape. If you can't find them; though; the airline will put it in a very heavy-duty plastic bag. Hope that helps; Expat Sueño P.S. I am starting a Mums and Kids group here in Doha for expats.

Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks	Hi; I am sure most of the guyz answered your query; if you need more details; read the follwoing: The role of the red blood cells is to carry oxygen through the body. The red blood cells can perform this task because of the presence of hemoglobin; the pigment that is formed when the red blood cells develop in the bone marrow. Each hemoglobin molecule is made up of a protein molecule called globin and four pigmented molecules of a compound called heme. Each heme molecule has one atom of iron; and there are four heme molecules in a single molecule of hemoglobin; hence; a single molecule of hemoglobin has four atoms of iron. This structure makes it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecules to form a substance called oxyhemoglobin. This reaction is reversible; enabling hemoglobin to pick up oxygen when the blood is in the lungs and to release oxygen in the cells when the blood is pumped to the tissues. In general; the blood of men usually has a greater concent.....	1

This is not secret just life in Doha. Corruption every where. Can you imagine that I fall 2 times at driving tests like I dont know how to drive... I have in my 50 years more then 20 diff. nice good cars... and I have more then 26 years driver lic. and more then 1.000.000 km behind me in all Europe countries... Not like new comer Indian people who use bicycle before and now make so many accident in Doha. Every day I see 5-6 accident. Driver? So sorry just true-Indian. GOod luck in driving with proper documents. Penalty is tooooo .....	0
I have visiting visa for work; so can I drive; I have egyptian license?	If you are on a visiting Visa and and you have an international driver license you can use it for 6 month I guess. If you get the permanent residence you can not use the Int driver license anymore.	1
I have visiting visa for work; so can I drive; I have egyptian license?	Mr.Calculator consumes major space for the same answer which is not helping the person with right answer?!; you can not drive a car with Egypitian licence here; as a visitor first 10 days you can drive but later you need to take a temporary driving licence for 3 months. you have to pay 100 riyal for every month and need to take eye-test for this licence.	0
I have visiting visa for work; so can I drive; I have egyptian license?	No; you cannot drive; you should have a GCC license not Egyptian.	0

I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	Even if you have a International License; you need to get a temporary license from Traffic Department. When you are in Doha; get the application for temporary license and submit it to the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department along with copy of your US license and passport pages showing your identity and visa page You might need to get an NOC from the sponsor (Typed in Arabic) if you visit here under visa from some company or sponsor. Best way is to ask the rental car company to assist you to get it.	0
I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	If you in vist visa you can drive; but if you want to cavnt to qatari ; so you can apply easly just vist to traffic dept and ask for new one.	1
I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	Supposedly the US license is good for (7) days. An international license is good for (6) months. They are easily obtained from AAA for about $15. After (6) months and likely before then you would need to go for a Qatar drivers license.	1
I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	I recommend that you go to a AAA agency and get an international license. Driving here in Doha is pretty dangerous- so I recommend you take every measure to protect yourself. It is pretty easy and not costly. See you when you get here!	2
Hello QatarLiving! My family and I will be away for vacation. PLEASE tell me about the reliable places in Doha where you put your dog in when you’re out of town!!

Hello QatarLiving! My family and I will be away for vacation. PLEASE tell me about the reliable places in Doha where you put your dog in when you’re out of town!! I don’t know where to take him and I don’t trust anyone to do that for me :-(	"""Ok; I have a cat. But we take him to Pampered Pets whenever we travel. They also board dogs... The do a great job; and I know lots of people who take their animals there. If your dog is social; he can play with the other dogs each day. If not; he can stay by himself. They cater to each individual animal and know them by name. (I'm """"Rackety's owner""""-- they know him; not me!) The only catch is that they book up really far in advance. Call as far in advance as you can to book your space. Website: www.ppkdoha.com You can see photos of the place and get all the details there. They are way out of town; but will pick up your dog if you can't make it out there."""	0

Hello guys..I want to take NHA licensure(Nurse) here in Qatar but I dont have any work experience in the Philippines..I'm currently working here now as a nurse in a construction company for almost 1yr..Will NHA allowed me to take licensure here even if I don't have the necessary experience required? Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..	You must have two years of work experience to apply for the license. You can work for another year and carry on with it. Since you are on company sponsorship I think you can work for another year and then apply. Hope this helps	0

Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..	You shouldn't be working ANYWHERE in Qatar WITHOUT an NHA license;so continuing in your current job for another year & then showing that to NHA as work experience may not be the best idea because as of now you are working ILLEGALLY!...you need to have minimum 2 years work experience OUTSIDE Qatar before coming here;if you could be employed legally here without an NHA license;what's the point of them conducting the exam???...so if you want to legally work in Qatar;go back to your home country(doesn't matter where as long as you work LEGALLY.);get two years LEGAL work experience then come back here;get your degree;certificates & work experience reviewed by Dataflow;then apply to take the licensure exam...	1

Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..	I think work experience is not a prerequisite for taking the NHA exam that is now handled by Prometric. You can try to schedule the exam online. However; there's no point of taking the exam without the required work experience since it is one of the requirements to get NHA license. Moreover; if you pass the exam; the validity is only for 2 years; otherwise you have to take it again.	1

Each employee is entitled to a free return air ticket within QR network for herself/himself; and her/his family (depending on one's grade). Which class they are entitled to is also dependent on the grade. They are also entitled to purchase discounted tickets; but that is on sub-load basis meaning the the seats are not confirmed and one could be bumped out in the last moment in case flights are full.

none	Until & Unless you are banned in the entire GCC... You can work in Qatar. Ban in Dubai doesn't mean a Ban in GCC.	2
none	Guys; It depends on the nature of the ban. Normally a ban is a no entry situation. If he is having a no entry stamp to Dubai then he will not be able to get visa to any of the GCC countries. The Immigration system of all the other countries will ave details of the person and it will normally block the visa. I know some guys in India unable to get visa to any other GCC countries because of the ban in Dubai.	2

In my view Qatar pay more Salary for workers in Gulf region. my friend argu Kuwait. which country paying more salary for workers?	I think it depends on your job but I would say the best payers are Saudi Arabia closely followed by Kuwait but neither of those places are pleasant enough to endure just for a few more bills in your pay cheque. The UAE pays ok and Abu Dhabi is a cheaper and more interesting place to live than Qatar.	0
In my view Qatar pay more Salary for workers in Gulf region. my friend argu Kuwait. which country paying more salary for workers?	Yeah; may be Qatar.

How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	Just today i went for the workpermit medical. I think the process works as follows: 1. Your company applies online for WP and you get a piece of paper that it is issued. - Max 1 week. 2. They get a medical date - another week max. 3. Finger printing - another 3-4 days. 4. WP card - another 2-3 days. above days are just from my personal experience and may vary.	0
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	these are two different things.. Tepgam67 is asking about Work permit while being on Family visa. shapil is talking about residence permit. that's what happens when unprofessional people try to give an advice. Tepgam67; if you have an RP here; to obtain a Work permit you need police clearance and the contract certified in MOL. How long it takes to finalize the process depends on several factors. ometimes it takes 3-4 days; sometimes it takes 1 month and even more. If you don't have an RP here (i.e. you are on 6 months family visa); you cannot work; and therefore you cannot obtain a Work permit.	0
Hi all; I hope some one to help me; I have an offer letter from a company in Qatar and by today it has been 2 monthes since I sent them all required papers for the Visa and still they said it's not ready yet.

Are the items inside Doha airport (Duty Free) cheaper compared to those that are sold inside the malls?	oh ok; my bad ! i read it wrongly !! i think its cheaper in Duty free but not Much of a difference.	0
Are the items inside Doha airport (Duty Free) cheaper compared to those that are sold inside the malls?	No; I've not noticed the price being cheaper in Duty Free. It's just more convenient; almost same price and on your way out plus weight does not count to your allowed limit.	2
Are the items inside Doha airport (Duty Free) cheaper compared to those that are sold inside the malls?	Yes it is	2
Are the items inside Doha airport (Duty Free) cheaper compared to those that are sold inside the malls?	Perfumes and Cosmetics are cheaper in all the Duty Free shops compared to the local market prices. It will be 15-20% cheaper through out the Duty Free shops in the world. Food items and confectionaries might not be cheaper in many cases. Electronics are cheaper in the local market.	2
Hi all.. We have a young baby [ 2 months old]. My wife has to resume work by the middle of September. We are looking for babycare options here. Is there any babysitting facility available in doha?	There is a regulated nursery service in doha but at premium rates and difficult to obtain a place; and now due to new regulations there are a reduced number of places. but with careful search you should be able to find a Nursery place. Do ask to see their Ministry registration. Outside of this there is the home provision by employing a Nanny; which is a costly activity initially. There is also many who will offer the service privately unregulated. Its your choice who you trust this small child with. Child care should be planned proir to the babys birth. we have nine months to plan for this day and children deserve the best decisions from us . check Doha Mums website . good Luck.	1

Hair Salon - Has anyone seen a Loreal Salon in Doha? I would assume it may be in one of the hotels/resorts. The salon would have Loreal branding on the window..... Thanks S	"""Do NOT go to Coiffure Francaise. I went in with very curly hair and asked Marie Claire; the hair dresser; to cut off ONE inch. She cut at least two inches off the overall length. I already had long layers and she asked me if I wanted layers and ended up cutting VERY short layers. She also cut the very front much shorter than the rest of my hair and then straightened the whole thing. I can not wear it curly because it looks REALLY bad. I have to spend extra time straightening my hair; and it's not growing quickly at all. I can't put it in a pony tail yet; and she cut it three weeks ago. If you see a girl around Doha that looks like she tried to give herself """"the Rachel"""" at home; that's me. :("""	2

If anyone of you knows a fitness gym here that offers Boxing please tell me. that would be a great help..Thanks!	rambee; visit aspire and ask about their evening sports activities. bring your passport or qatar id because you need to register before you could avail of their multifacted sports activities. you pay a minimal fee monthly because aspire is subsidized by the government. some sports they have include boxing; swimming; various ball games; yoga; and others. one good thing about their evening program is that each sports class has a professional instructor dedicated not merely to teach but also to ensure student health and safety. i will go to aspire than enrol in any other chic gym here in qatar. Good luck!	2

I am thinking of changing gyms when I go back this time; but I wanna train early in the morning as opposed to regular hours when they are crowded; anyone know of any 24 hour gyms in Qatar? I doubt they exist knowing Qatar...	"""The gym at Intercon is open 24/7.

I am thinking of changing gyms when I go back this time; but I wanna train early in the morning as opposed to regular hours when they are crowded; anyone know of any 24 hour gyms in Qatar? I doubt they exist knowing Qatar...	who already have land..and as far as picking up after folks..yes..but that happens everywhere...and is part of the staff's job. The gym equip at Sheraton is actually quite a decent variety; and hotel gyms are basically the only choice with the exception of Golds..but for me that would mean driving completely across town to get there. But...still; to have a gym that has everything/everyone necessary; would be pure heaven... As far as those that use steriods; etc. to gain muscle..those guys have always reminded me of the old cartoon character Atom Ant...HUGE body with a itty bitty head...in fact; I always end up laughing when i see them..and I know they can't figure out why.

Hello everyone; i am coming to Doha soon from South Africa and i beleive that once i am there i need an exit permit to leave; does anyone know what this means. Can i visit Dubai without an exit permit;Â  i know i cant come to South Africa with out a permit????	Your biggest problem being you have a south african passport my friend is in the same boat! If you are on a business visa then the answer is yes if you want to leave the country you HAVE to have a exit visa if you are on a visit visa then no you do not but you will need a visa to get into Dubai!	0
Hello everyone; i am coming to Doha soon from South Africa and i beleive that once i am there i need an exit permit to leave; does anyone know what this means. Can i visit Dubai without an exit permit;Â  i know i cant come to South Africa with out a permit????	you only need an exit permit once you have got a Residence Permit (RP). The exit permit is given to you by your RP sponsor. It can be issued per trip; however; i advise you to get a one year multi exit.	0

Can i visit Dubai without an exit permit;Â  i know i cant come to South Africa with out a permit????	So you will be on a business visa until your RP comes through all you have to do is tell your company when you are going and they will apply for a exit visa which is just a piece of paper really saying you are allowed to go and they will also get you the entrance visa for when you come back! You can go wher you like just remember to check if you need a visa for the other countries you wish to visit! Also make sure they have done your business visa before you fly out so it is sorted for when you land!	1

Can i visit Dubai without an exit permit;Â  i know i cant come to South Africa with out a permit????	No on a business visa you can fly out as many times as you wish so that just might be a company thing iam on a business visa and so are three of my friends one being a south african like yourself and we fly out for weekends all the time! It could be because it is a pain in the bum and alot of paper work for them that they are saying only one exit! But if you have an emergency they you are also allowed	0
Qatar - Bahrain Causeway bridge is this project is under hold or going on????	on very hold for multiple reasons!	1
Qatar - Bahrain Causeway bridge is this project is under hold or going on????	the project is onhold for some reason; Da Vinci a french based company is initiating the project; which was suppose to finish in 2016; but not yet started.	1
Qatar - Bahrain Causeway bridge is this project is under hold or going on????	Qatar will have long distant rail lines to KSA and Bahrain. The one which will be laid from Doha to Manama would go through the causeway. Thus; design modifications will have to be done to accommodate the railway line which was not thought of before in the original design. This could be one of the reasons for the 'hold' if at all.	2
Can i change from work sponsor to husband sponsor even if i am only three months in my company? please advise. thanks.	You will require NOC from your sponsor allowing you to transfer to husband sponsorship. If they give you one; then you can transfer regardless if you are only 3 months with them.	2
Can i change from work sponsor to husband sponsor even if i am only three months in my company? please advise. thanks.	Only transfer from one company to another requires minimum of 1 year stay from the previous company; as per the labour law. husband sponsorship; i doubt there is minimum requirement. You just need to apply for a labour card in case you want to work.	2
Can i change from work sponsor to husband sponsor even if i am only three months in my company? please advise. thanks.	If your husband's salary is still below QR10;000 he cannot sponsor you and your kids. You said your kids are under your sponsorship; so why do you want to transfer? If you have a better job position and salary than your husband then let the sponsorship stay as it is.	1
Can i change from work sponsor to husband sponsor even if i am only three months in my company? please advise. thanks.	You won't get an approval if your husband's salary is below 10;000...the reason behind it is you cannot live comfortably if your whole family is with you; and the head of the family earning only 5;000. Way back 2007; the limit is minimum 7;000...2010 onwards; they raised it to 10;000 due to higher cost of living. You cannot add wife's salary to make the 10;000...	1

"Where do I pay a speeding ticket fine? The www.moi.gov.qa website says that I got my picture taken last month. I've heard that """"most people don't pay fines until they come to sell the car""""; I've also heard that the fine gets increased by 10% for every month it isn't paid. I'd rather pay now. Thanks!"""	You used to be able to pay it online at the e-Government site but that's been under maintenance for a long time now. Go to the traffic department either at Madinat Khalifa or Airport to pay. You need to renew your car's road permit once a year. That's when uou have to do a traffic violations check before they renew the permit. Fines don't increase. You just have to pay it when your road permit is up or if you're involved in a car accident; they check for violations then.	1

I've been there only once; but I can't remember the place. It is kind of tricky and not that easy to be found. I tried to post earlier but I was disconnected and it seems that my post is not here. Man you can pay at any time but before renewing your car registration. When you go for that they will ask you to clear all the violations that you got. First time I hear about the 10% thing; might be a new thing but never hear of it. The guys are right as well as the Airport one is less crowded than the Khalifa branch. You can also pay for that in 'Giant Stores' or 'Villagio' as I remember. I saw an office there for the Traffic Department. There is also in 'Hammad Hospital' down there near the Parking area down there. It is empty all the time. Good Luck	0

U can pay the fine online at http://www.e.gov.qa/eGovPortal/index.jsp There is no fine increase every month.	2

But incase of your wife; she can ask from her company to issue NOC to her stating that her company won't object while she transfers her company visa to husband visa..There is no need for her to even exit QATAR.. Incase; if her company doesn't willing to give her NOC and no transfer of VISA; she can leave QATAR and can come back on HUSBAND VISA provided that you(husband)should meet all the norms and criteria that is normally required once applying for FAMILY VISA...You should be earning a salary of around QR7000 or more than that..	0
What is the computation of Gratuity or END OF SERVICE BENEFITS for the working period of 7 years? Thanks to confirm....	21 days per year	1
What is the computation of Gratuity or END OF SERVICE BENEFITS for the working period of 7 years? Thanks to confirm....	according to the Qatar Labour Law; Article 54 In addition to any sums to which the worker is entitled to upon the expiry of his service; the employer shall pay the end of service gratuity to the worker who has completed employment of one year or more. This gratuity shall be agreed upon by the two parties; provided that it is not less than a three-week wage for every year of employment. The worker shall be entitled to gratuity for the fractions of the year in proportion to the duration of employment. The worker's service shall be considered continuous if it is terminated in cases other than those stipulated in article (61) of this Law and is returned to service within two months of its termination. The last basic wage shall be the base for the calculation of the gratuity. The employer is entitled to deduct from the service gratuity the amount due to him by the worker.	1
What is the computation of Gratuity or END OF SERVICE BENEFITS for the working period of 7 years? Thanks to confirm....	service gratuity is granted minimum of 1 year continuous service in the company. the computation is like: gratuity=last basic salary X 70% (this is 21 days) X length of service in years	1
What is the computation of Gratuity or END OF SERVICE BENEFITS for the working period of 7 years? Thanks to confirm....	example: last basic salary: QR10;000 length of service: 5 years {10000 x 0.70} X 5 = QR 35000 note: 21 days or 70% is minimum requirement from labour law.

How many more times will you fall for this trap? Why don't you ask from the beginning for an NOC (with the date being filled in later)? If they refuse; they will for sure make a problem for you; and you should never consider working for them!	2

A couple of things you need to know... If you arrived here on a business visa from Phil; and then you went on to your company sponsorship; then you are not classed as a local recruit. So... your employer does not have to give you NOC. Next thing... even if your employer gives you NOC; you will be able to transfer your sponsorship to another employer for at least one year. The rules as I know are that you should complete 2 years with your employer before you can transfer. But; normally after a year Labour will transfer the sponsorship Think about this twice before you go ahead. Hope this helps with making your decision :o)	2

Thank you	as a french woman married Qatari i can go my country with my french passport. but be carrful:*if your hasband doesnt agree you travel alone he can go to the immigration to dont alowed you traveling alone(only with with him or father ;brother..) *if you get the passport qatari after 5 years its impossible as a woman to travel alone BUT IF your hasband is agree he has to go to the aeroport to make an authorization. by the way : to get married in Qatar he has to get the permission from the ministry of interior to get married an western or europeen woman(need this autorization for all wonam no GCC).iTS NOT EASY TO GET THIS AUTHORIZATION!!!more if his work in the gouvernement(army;police..) also to married in Qatar you have to be muslim and get the paper in Al Fanar.

Thank you	The questions you ask depends on the husband just like any where in the world you can marry a good one or a controlling one. If he turns out to be controlling your life could well be hell and yes he could take your passport off you and control your travel.	2

I do hope someone can answer my query. by the way i'm from Philippines. Regards; JM	If the company has available visa for your nationality; teh2008 is right you can get it in a day or two. But there are factors why your visa has not been released yet; e.g. the PRO is lazy; the PRO is on vacation; no visa approval yet; the position is on hold; other internal factors from your employer or agent etc. Better confirm again with your agent in the Phils. to remind the employer:)	2

If there are some problems; it might never be issued.	2

Hi All. Does anyone know any good moving companies in Doha? A company that will move all my stuff without damaging anything; and possible pack it all up for me as well. The move is local; within Doha.	You can contact Mr. Kabeer at 5335914. He shifted my stuff last year and the service was excellent. Nothing broke but he is not with any company. He operates independantly.	2

Hi All. Does anyone know any good moving companies in Doha? A company that will move all my stuff without damaging anything; and possible pack it all up for me as well. The move is local; within Doha.	Try a company called Runway International. They are pretty effecient. The number is 443 1529	0
Hi All. Does anyone know any good moving companies in Doha? A company that will move all my stuff without damaging anything; and possible pack it all up for me as well. The move is local; within Doha.	Hi All. I used Mr. Kabeer for my recent move within Doha. His price was very reasonable; a third of the price of the major moving companies. They packed everything up for me. I had to organise my own boxes which I did from QMart at the Mall; and they put all my stuff into them for me. They were quite careful with my stuff and no serious damage was incurred; but I had to supervise that they packed the fragile items carefully; and instruct them on what to put in each box. I strongly recommend him; but as with any move; supervise that the valuables and fragiles items are packed carefully or even better; by yourself. Also; be on hand to manage the packing.	2
Hi All. Does anyone know any good moving companies in Doha? A company that will move all my stuff without damaging anything; and possible pack it all up for me as well. The move is local; within Doha.	After reading your comments; I thought I'd give Mr Kabeer a ring yesterday. He arranged to come over... and I waited for 5 hours for him. When I tried to ring him to find out where he was; he didn't answer - I called four times. Then today he rang and said he was outside my place - apart from the fact that I'm working today and he's 24 hours late.... Hardly reliable; so just as well I'm not taking him On the upside; I tried Runway International. They turned up on time; took 10 minutes assessing everything and asking all the right questions... they may be more expensive than Kabeer; but at least they'll show up!	2

Does anyone know if there's an indoor rock-climbing wall (or outdoor; for that matter) anywhere in Doha? Thanks!!	hey guys; seeing there's a few climbing nuts aside of me. i've been scouting out some good bouldering and deep water soloing spots but only through internet cos i'm not actually in qatar yet...from the images i've found; seems there's some nice climeable rock a couple hours' drive out of doha. if any of you would like to tag along and go take a peak once i'm there; i'm sure if we put our heads together we can find a few respectable crags to keep going.. anyways keep me posted. would be nice to meet a few fellow climbers. cheers; K	2
I have heard that it&#39;s really fun to drive from Qatar to Dubai on the weekend (obviosly if you have a 4 X 4 Drive). My question is do I need to get a visa if I want to go to Dubai if I have a Residence Permit of Qatar?	Although you can go to dubai and get visa on arrival if you are going by air but road travel is different. You have to pass Saudi border and you need saudi visa. In order to get saudi visa you have to get UAE visa first. Saudi gives visa only after you already have UAE visa on your passport. Hope this clarifies.	2

The whole process will take you 8 days. 3 days to get UAE visa and 5 days to get saudi transit visa. count the weekend	2

But for saudi transit visa just go to the agent and you will get it stamped in 5days.	2
Hi; This Ramadan we will be going to Dubai by road. We have done it twice before and have always got a visa on arrival at the UAE border. The difference is this time we will be taking along our housemaid. My question is will she also get a visa on arrival at the UAE border? Thanks	Iam afraid she wont as she aint under ur sponsorship. Its only permitted for locals to take their housemaids or driver in their sponsorship. anyways; i can be wrong as well. The agency from where you get your Saudi Transit visa can advise you on this.	0

The difference is this time we will be taking along our housemaid. My question is will she also get a visa on arrival at the UAE border? Thanks	You will need to get a transit visa for her with a no objection letter to the Saudi Embassy typed in Arabic. You will need to get her a Visa from UAE Embassy here in Qatar before you travel. She will not be issue a visa on Arrival. I suggest just leave her home	2
My wife I want to drive to the UAE; next month. I understand about the visa situation; and I can cope with that.

My friend told me he seems to remember hearing that it was not possible; and that somehow; they know this at the border and will not allow me to leave. Can anyone confirm this? Thanks for your help. Cheers!	Hi Hannibal It depends on your bank; Some banks like QNB need a garantee from Qatari citizin; Some others like Commercial if your salary is transfered to them no need for that. it is better to chech with your bank regulations Best of luck; and pls tell me wt is the final status coz i planning for the same	0

hi QLrs.. could u pls advice; after how many weeks a new born baby can travel outside qatar via Qatarairways and does the baby needs visa to come qatar again after few months?	So to answer the question; i'm not certain if you are inquiring about Airlines policy or government visa policy.... If its the former; best thing to do is call QATAR AIRWAYS and ask them. If it's the latter; then maybe there's a government agency you can ask? When my daughter was born (here in Doha); she didn't travel till she was 6 months old; but we were told the law was that she had to have a residency Visa within a month of being born....so by the time she travelled she had it. Hope that helps somewhat; and good luck. Stay safe all. Perfection does not exist. The question therefore; is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?	2
hi QLrs.. could u pls advice; after how many weeks a new born baby can travel outside qatar via Qatarairways and does the baby needs visa to come qatar again after few months?

hi QLrs.. could u pls advice; after how many weeks a new born baby can travel outside qatar via Qatarairways and does the baby needs visa to come qatar again after few months?	for the visa; better get it before the travel to avoid furture hassles. but i would suggest that you let the baby grow old a few months more before you take him/her travelling on an airplane. just imagine even an adult do have some problms with air pressure inside the cabin of an aircraft; what more would a few weeks old or a month old baby feel about this? (he/she'll be crying all the way to your destination) if that's the case.	2
hi QLrs.. could u pls advice; after how many weeks a new born baby can travel outside qatar via Qatarairways and does the baby needs visa to come qatar again after few months?	my son first travel at 4 mths; as soon as he got his RP. Make sure you ready with bottle of milk for feeding during take off and landing because infant have a sensitive ear and the change air pressure in the cabin make the baby uncomfortable.	2
hi QLrs.. could u pls advice; after how many weeks a new born baby can travel outside qatar via Qatarairways and does the baby needs visa to come qatar again after few months?	when he traveled for the first time.... As per doctor's advice and as Novita said; I gave him a bottle of milk during take off and landing...and everything was ok... Just make sure to issue him passport and stamp the ikama (RP) on it before you travel.	2
hi QLrs.. could u pls advice; after how many weeks a new born baby can travel outside qatar via Qatarairways and does the baby needs visa to come qatar again after few months?	i bought my baby girl when she was three weeks old. she is now healthy and fine. i normaly assume the baby can travel after two weeks from qatar airways. you have to feed baby during take off and landing to avoid pressure diffrence. and should keep your hands clean (by wet wipes) before you touch the baby to avoid contamination. visa can be obtained on arrival for the baby.	2
